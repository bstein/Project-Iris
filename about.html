        When I first started on this project in January 2020,
        at the beginning of my last semester of my undergraduate studies, I quite
        frankly wasn’t sure what form it would ultimately take. For most of the
        semester, this remained the case. Even as I was designing various mockups
        (i.e., drawings of apps), I wouldn’t have been able to say anything other than
        I was working to create something depicting my personal take on mobile app
        design. The mockups were, for the most part, insulated from the murkiness of my
        overall vision for what the final form of this project might be. Sketch quickly
        became the app that I opened to simply experiment with different ideas, in
        order to discover broader themes that I would apply to mobile app design. As it
        turned out, discovering and documenting those themes–for both a general
        audience and designers looking to try something fresh–was the key to unlocking
        the final doors.

        For years, I have kept a tradition of naming personal
        projects alphabetically after various colors. As it turns out, Wikipedia has an
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_colors">alphabetized list of
        color names</a>, which is the first thing I turn to when I decide exactly which color I
        want to name my project after. While I haven’t published all of my personal
        projects (indicated by whether there’s a link), at the beginning of the
        semester I already had:
        <a href="https://www.baileystein.com/projects/project-aureolin.html">Project Aureolin</a>,
        Project Blue,
        <a href="https://github.com/bstein/Project-Cadmium">Project Cadmium</a>,
        <a href="https://www.baileystein.com/projects/project-desire.html">Project Desire</a>,
        <a href="https://www.baileystein.com/projects/project-emerald.html">Project Emerald</a> (my final project for gateway!),
        <a href="https://bstein.github.io/Project-Flame/">Project Flame</a>,
        Project Gunmetal, and
        <a href="https://www.baileystein.com/projects/facefinder.html">Project Harlequin</a> (“Face Finder” production
        name). So, when it was time to begin working on my capstone project, I needed
        to choose a color name that began with “I”. I decided to name it “Project Iris,”
        although I have since dropped the “Project” prefix and have made the “i” lowercase,
        resulting in simply “iris”.

        When I presented this project to my classmates for
        feedback, Ashley commented that she liked the name as it was “like a lens into
        the design world”. While I initially hadn’t thought about the name like that, I
        certainly did afterwards! That idea undoubtedly helped me land on the final
        form of the project: this website, which showcases “ten guidelines for mobile
        app design”. I figured this would be the best way to present what I had learned
        throughout the semester, as it meant aligning the project with the idea of
        being “a lens into the digital world”. With this, I turned my focus on making
        iris digestible for a more general audience and providing “guidelines” based on
        what I had learned as I designed mockups for three different apps: notes,
        music, and messaging (in that order).

        For me, iris provided the opportunity to challenge
        typical mobile app design norms. It gave me space to create designs that go
        against the grain; it’s not about being minimalist but rather embracing
        minimalism in a new way. There’s (what I hope is) a clear focus on minimizing
        typical barriers that make mobile apps feel distant. Following these guidelines
        results in app designs that put content front and center. I believe this is how
        it should be. Apps shouldn’t be designed to “hook” users–they should instead be
        designed to look like they’re part of a larger “flow”: one that effortlessly
        washes over a user as they go about their daily life. Although “flow” is itself
        one of ten guidelines in total, it’s also deeply tied to the other guidelines.
        And the sum of these guidelines is... iris.
